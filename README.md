# Inventory Applications Development Tool

This is the test rig for whatmovateslearning.com profiles and inventory applications.
If you look at the directory structure you'll find a folder called *completed rings*. These contain the classes which make each profile different within the code base found in the folder *jsLIB*. Swap out the three files in the subfolder in *completed rings* with the versions in the *jsLIB* folder. The inventory modality will change as will the associated reporting.

Written principly in jQuery and jsPDF, the app will create a pdf report on completion of the questionaire and attempt to save the report to your downloads foler.
